# InfoTrack
Simply download compile and run on any IIS server.
There is no additional configuration, project is basing on standartd MVC project template.
No database used.
On default home page you should see text field where you can provide search term and search button to run search for phrase in google and check if InfoTrack.co.uk appears in results. If yes, then number or result position will be shown. I kept this very simple because of the lack of time.
